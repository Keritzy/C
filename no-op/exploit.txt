// Here is an example of a payload that uses the no-op slide technique to exploit the vulnerable function in the C code 
// In this example, the vulnerable function has a buffer of size 128 bytes, but it copies the user-provided input to the buffer without checking its length. This means that if the user provides an input that is longer than 128 bytes, the input will overflow the buffer and overwrite the adjacent memory locations.
// To exploit this vulnerability using the no-op slide technique, the attacker would need to create a payload that contains a large number of no-op instructions, followed by the address of the arbitrary code they want to execute. The attacker would then provide this payload as the input to the vulnerable function, causing the program to execute the arbitrary code at the specified address.
